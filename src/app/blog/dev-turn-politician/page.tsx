        I will tell you how a geek can excel an election. I will try to
          explain it through my personal experience. I know you will find it
          worth it.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The problems are one thing which motivates human to take action. My
          set of problems were divided into 2 category:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Non-Democratic system <br />
          2. My own communication issues
          <br />
          <br />
          1) Let&apos;s talk about non-democratic system first. By system, I don&apos;t
          mean the election process was rigged, but the way people take part in
          it. The people don&apos;t seem to care about who was on council, and
          whenever any stupid decision was taken by the administration, student
          wrote angry words in their Instagram stories (which make no sense as
          director doesn&apos;t follow you). The student representatives are
          responsible to put student POV in front of the administration, but
          they were not doing their job properly.
          <br />
          <br />
          Below stated are steps to become a Student Representative:
          <h1 className="ml-4">
            <br />
            1. In your 1st year, join a club with huge population that
            does&apos;t do real work. (For IITR it is UBA, CDC, Students club
            council, NSS, IRC just to name a few, and yes I just read my
            opponent manifesto)
            <br />
            2. Then you pick a senior, who you think is the most popular in the
            club, and hold most/highest Position of responsibilities (POR)
            <br />
            3. Then you talk, and talk to him and his friend as much as
            possible. You do his chores, and you accompany him etc etc.
            <br />
            4. Then you start partying with him, you drink with him, you smoke
            with him, you do everything with him.
            <br />
            5. It is a kind of trade, you do his work, and he will make you his
            successor.
          </h1>
          <br />
          But the problem with this system is that Hostel and college is never
          the priority for the one in-charge and same for the disciple. And if
          no-one question there dynastic rule, then the system will never
          change, and condition will not improve. <br />
          Until they feel that their position is challenged, they will not work
          for the betterment of the hostel.
          <br />
          <br />
          2) This may be quite personal, but I struggled with communication as a
          child, rarely engaging with others. However, I&apos;ve made
          significant progress since then and recognize there&apos;s still much
          room for growth. For one, I am writing this very personal blog,
          inviting everyone to inner-working of my mind and opening a room for
          Criticism from complete strangers.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The obstacle</h2>
          Aarsh Choudhary(Yes, we have same surname), he is the arch nemesis of
          this story. Also we call his type of people &quot;Polibaaz&quot;, he
          belongs to party called &quot;BJP&quot; which stands for &quot;Bihar,
          Jharkhand, Purvanchal&quot; (ik names are hilarious). <br /> From first year
          onward these type of people come to your room, snatch your phone and
          vote for their fav senior. Then these type of people work their way up
          the social ladder and then they get to the position of power. Rule is
          simple, you work hard for someone, that someone will give you political
          Patronage.
          <br />
          Some of his other qualities is that he likes to drink, smoke etc stuff
          which I think are okay, but he does it to gain favour and make bonds,
          I just find it cringe tbh.
          <br />
          He is also my batch mate(Yes we are from same branch), and he was the
          first person I talked to in college. He was my first friend
          technically in college. But as time passed, I saw his true colours. He
          was weak, enable to take criticism, and he was a bully. A type of person
          you want to keep away for your piece of mind.
          <br />
          <br />
          His dad is kinda rich. He likes to brag, that also just makes me
          want to stab myself whenever he opens his mouth.
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Solution Part 1</h2>
          {/* <br /> <br /> */}I found people who thought the way I thought, who
          related with the undemocratic problem. Who were tired of eating shitty
          food in the mess, while other messes made perfect food. One of them
          was Bhuvan, who also was from the most populous branch in our hostel
          and people liked him in general.
          <br />
          It was actually his that I should stand for this position. I was not
          sure, but he was, he believed in me. He guided me through the entire
          process, telling me about all the procedures, helped in manifesto,
          while he still was in his sister&apos;s wedding.
          <br />
          So the list of Candidates actually leaked a day prior (I just claimed,
          the process was nearly fair, no cheating on votes part). I just woke
          up and got a call from Akshat, my friend from 1st year(He is a good
          guy). He told me why have I kept this candidature secret from him.
          Then He said Aarsh (The opponent) is in his room, he wants to talk, I
          said I don&apso;t want to. He insisted and then I thought what the
          heck, let&apso;s face it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Aarsh pleaded that I take down my candidature (I was wondering while
          he was speaking why withdrawal option exist). He requested, then tried
          intimidating me and many other methods like making me realize how this
          will be a huge humiliation and I will lose.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the evening around 12 in the morning, I got another call from Aman
          (Again a good senior). He again tried convincing me to withdraw my
          candidature. His take was I will get exhausted by the intensity of the
          &apos;politics&apos;. He was doing this because his friends was
          forcing him to, (The seniors, who supported Aarsh, by support he
          gained by doing things in Problem 1).
          <br />
          I went back to my room, then Aman called again, and this time those
          &apos;seniors&apos; were in the room. They tried all possible way to
          convince me, humiliation, exhaustion, or counting the ways Aarsh was
          better etc, etc so this went on for 1 hour to be precise. Sounds shitty
          right, ain&apos;t it? Feels wrong, but they were not scared. (I said EC
          was okayish, not the best). After hearing from more people like them,
          i didn&apos;t withdraw my candidature. Its in turn motivated me to do
          better.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Solution Part 2</h2>
          Now time for 3 day Campaigning started, I was not sure at first how to
          approach this, I did what in general my opponent was doing, making a
          poster and promotional video and distributing it on WhatsApp groups
          and people Instagram.
          <br />
          1st day went by like nothing, everything was shitty. Heck it! I was
          sad and feeling shitty, I was not able to do anything. People prophecy
          was coming true. But the gate of my room was open, then a dude who
          lives near my room came in talked to me. He was surprised that stood
          for election and told me that the fact that a geek person was taking
          part in elections was really enticing and that really attracted him to
          my cause. He also told me not that not many of his friends knew that I
          was standing for election, and they didn&apos;t even knew there were
          election going to happen in the Bhawan.
          <br />
          <br />
          From this convo I needed to tell people that I exist and I am like
          them, I am not a politician, I am a student who is tired current
          system. By politician, I obviously mean the people like Aarsh (who
          works hard all their college life to get to this position). I started
          banging on doors, I started talking to people, I told them about
          Problem 1. Obviously this was not easy, many people hated the fact
          that I was at their door and was disturbing their daily routine, and I
          was surprised by the number of people who were willing to talk to me.
          The sheer number of people who invited me inside the room, sat with me
          and listened to me. They were all tired, some thousands of kilometres
          away from their home of the unhygienic condition of washrooms, the bad
          food, the lack of clean laundry. All this time, Usman and sometime
          Pranav was with me, they helped me in talking to people, they were my
          support system.
          <br />
          <br />
          I found some observations about people via this: <br />
          <h1 className="ml-4">
            1) Many people won&apos;t bite you, when you go talk to them. <br />
            2) People become more comfortable when they are in group.(Might make
            you nervous tho) <br />
            3) People hate when you don&apos; listen to them, they want to be
            heard. <br />
            4) Some people are just shitty. <br /> <br />
          </h1>
          I talked to nearly 300 students, listened to their problems. It was a
          nice experience, met really nice people. <br />
          Debate was another highlight, I was told that people will crush me in
          the Debate by the People in Aman&apos;s room. They will shout at me,
          interrupt me and will not let me speak. For Debate, I was scared
          shitless, I was prepared but scared shitless. First, my opponent gave
          his speech, in plain English which he memorized, and then I gave mine,
          in Hindi. That was a big plus, people felt my words, and I was super
          surprised when the people cheered instead of shouting at me. The only
          problem during debate was Aarsh, he was forcing his friend(WatchOut
          member, watchout conduct the debate) to not let me speak in Hindi.
          Speaking in any language was allowed, EC is not perfect, its just good
          enough.
          <br />
          <br />
          I knew I was going to be intimidated, but the limits were crossed when
          the Aarsh went to rooms of people who were putting up my manifesto in
          their status. They were just showing their support and what they got
          to show their support was a threat talk from their seniors, how sad
          the senior was that they were supporting me. For someone not from IITR
          this might seem like a small things but people here are connected
          with their seniors, they are like the only guiding figure in college life.
          Some people get good seniors(I think I got the best) some bad(Aarsh
          got the worst ones).
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The End</h2>
          The thing you need to know about election is that it happens 9am in
          the morning which I found (During Campaigning) the favourite time for
          IITR student to sleep.
          <br />
          So the general strategy of these politicians is to get their
          friends/upcoming politicians to wake up people, snatch their phone and
          vote for Aarsh. So according to sources Aarsh had group of 40 people
          waking people up for him. There 7 floor in RKB, and 40/7 = 6 people
          per floor. So 6 people per floor were waking up people for Aarsh.
          <br />
          And as a geek, who just started into politics, I had no-one to run for
          me. Actually, I had 3 people. Usman(A fucking ninja), Akshat went to
          ground floor to wake up some people, and Tanishq, he called his 4
          friends. We later joked how big and important Tanishq contribution
          was.
          <br />
          So there was also some other shit, how election started 15 min before
          it was supposed to etc. Saw lots of people roaming outside the
          room, a lot of other stuff happened (minor). Voting time ended and I
          slept thinking I did the best I could. Actually that was my mantra, I
          just want to do as best I could.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now comes the result day, a lot of people were refreshing the result
          website just to see the result. I didn&apos;t knew if I won, I did
          made the entire process a lot interesting.
          <br />
          Then I get a call from DoSW office, they called me in, I was scared. I
          reached the office, I still remember I was wearing a shirt which read{" "}
          <br />
          &quot;I sorry but I don&apos;t care about your opinion.&quot; <br />{" "}
          The DoSW, AdoSW, and AdoSW Hostel Affair were sitting in the office.
          They told me there was complained against me for distributing physical
          poster, it was true, but I didn&apos;t knew it was illigal. Nothing in
          the guideline said that I can&apos;t distribute physical poster.{" "}
          <br /> Well that led to a tie, and heck I was happy, I couldn&apos;t
          believe what I was witnessing. I was feeling a mix of sadness and
          feeling of accomplishment. I finally did something which I thought was
          impossible.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Conclusion</h2>
          After few days of hostel warden took the interview, and he decided
          that Aarsh was a better choice for the position. I respect his
          decision, but I was happy that working 7 days straight, talking to
          people, and making them aware of the problems was not a waste of time.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now the result didn&apos;t turned out as I hoped for, but I saw
          something which I never saw before. I saw people coming together and
          asking why was the food shitty, why the water cooler never works, why
          the washroom was always dirty. They were questioning the system, and
          that was the biggest win for me.
